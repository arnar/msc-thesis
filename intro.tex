Among the most important and ubiquitous concepts in Computer Science are \emph{languages}.
In almost every sub-field of Computer Science, one can find specific languages for
describing and reasoning about the concepts of that field. Programming languages
are the best known example of course, but file formats, network protocols,
instruction sets and even the various diagram techniques used in Software
Engineering can be considered as languages. Theoretical Computer Science has
specification languages and various logics. Natural Language Processing has markup
languages for describing voicing and sentence structure. Artificial Intelligence
uses specific languages for describing behaviour, the rules of games and the
constraints of planning problems. Indeed, it seems to be common practice in 
Computer Science to invent formalisms for specific problems, and these formalisms
very often involve some kind of languages.

Any language consists of two parts; its \emph{syntax} and its \emph{semantics}.
The syntax defines what strings of symbols are valid, i.e. part of the language,
while the semantics define the actual \emph{meaning} of any valid string.
It has become a standard part of undergraduate curriculum of Computer Science to
teach students how syntax can be specified formally and this is vital. However,
formal specification of semantics still seems to be confined to post-graduate
studies. One could argue that this is a bit strange since it is really the different
\emph{meaning} of languages that sets them apart, much rather than their syntax.
However, it is not the purpose of this thesis to offer any further opinion on
this matter. Rather it is a study, by way of example, of one certain technique of specifying
semantics formally, namely \emph{Structural Operational Semantics}. To put things
in context, we'll start by a general overview.


\section{Structural Operational Semantics}

Structural Operational Semantics, SOS or simply Operational Semantics for short,
is a way of defining the meaning of sentences in formal languages. By
\emph{formal languages} we mean any language for specifying ideas formally in the mathematical
sense. This includes programming languages, process languages for modelling and
verification as well as many others. By \emph{sentences} we usually mean programs
or specifications written in these languages.
