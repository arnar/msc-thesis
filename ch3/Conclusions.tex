\section{\label{sec::conc}Conclusions}
In this paper, we presented two rule formats  guaranteeing determinism of certain transitions and idempotency of binary operators.
Our rule formats cover all practical cases of determinism and idempotency that we have thus far encountered in the literature.

We plan to extend our rule formats with the addition of data/store.
Also, it is interesting to study the addition of structural congruences pertaining to idempotency
to the TSSs in our idempotency format.
