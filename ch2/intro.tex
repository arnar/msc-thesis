\section{Introduction}
State-space explosion is a major obstacle in model-checking logical properties.
One approach to combat this problem is compositional reasoning,
where properties of a system as a whole are deduced from the properties of its components.
Decompositional reasoning \cite{Giannakopoulou05,Xie05} improves upon compositional reasoning by
automatically decomposing the global property into local properties of (possibly unknown) components.
In the context of process algebras, as the specification language, and Hennessy-Milner logic, as the logical formalism for properties,
decompositional reasoning techniques date back to the seminal work of Larsen and Xinxin in early 90's \cite{Larsen91},
which is further developed in \cite{Simpson04,Fokkink06}.
However, we are not aware of any such decomposition technique which applies to reasoning about ``past''.
This is particularly interesting in the light of recent developments concerning reversible processes and
knowledge representation (epistemic aspects) inside process algebra,
all of which involve some notion of specification and reasoning about past.


In this paper, we tackle this problem and present a decomposition technique for Hennesy Milner logic with past.
As the specification language, we use a subset CCS with parallel composition, non-deterministic choice, action prefixing
and the inaction constant.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
