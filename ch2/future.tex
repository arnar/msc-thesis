\label{sec:decomp_future}

So far we have stated and proven a decompositional theorem that allows us to
apply decompositional reasoning for history-based computations over CCS and
the logic $\HMLpast$. However, more work remains to be done in order to apply
this theory to meaningful examples. Part of this work is well underway already
although the details have not been worked out fully for this particular thesis
submission. In particular, we have extended the decompositional theorem to a
recursive logic $\HMLppf{\X}$, which allows a much wider class of interesting 
properties to be specified as fix-points of systems of recursive logic equations.
